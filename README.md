# Cryptocurrencies

## Quick Summary

The purpose of this analysis was to look at avaliable crypto currencies and how they are grouped together. Using an unsupervised model we were able to group the different cryptos without any assumptions or pre conceieved thoughts. By using a clustering algorithm we are able to initially group these currencies. The next step in the analysis would be to figure out WHY these currencies are grouped the way they are.
